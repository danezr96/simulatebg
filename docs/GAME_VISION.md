**SimulateBG – Game Vision & Product Definition (v1.0)**

---

## 1. Elevator pitch

**SimulateBG** is a persistent, single-world business simulation where players build a holding company across multiple sectors, compete in a living economy, and make long-term strategic decisions that carry real risk.

This is **not** a tycoon clicker and **not** a casual idle game.  
It is a **serious, systems-driven business simulator** designed for players who enjoy strategy, finance, and long-horizon planning.

> *“Run a real holding company in a world that doesn’t pause for you.”*

---

## 2. Core fantasy

The player fantasy is:

- You are a **capital allocator**, not a shop manager
- You operate **multiple companies**, not a single business
- You think in **weeks, quarters, and years**
- Every decision has **delayed consequences**
- Failure is possible — and meaningful

There is no scripted story.  
The story **emerges from the economy**.

---

## 3. What makes SimulateBG different

### 3.1 Persistent world
- One shared world (for now)
- Economy ticks forward whether you are online or not
- No resets, no seasons-as-rounds, no hand-holding

### 3.2 Discrete time simulation
- 1 round = 1 in-game week
- 52 weeks = 1 year
- Deterministic simulation per round
- Full historical replay possible

### 3.3 Real economic structure
- Cashflow, balance sheets, debt
- Interest rates, inflation, labor cost
- Sector trends & volatility
- Capacity constraints & overinvestment penalties

### 3.4 True failure
- Companies can go bankrupt
- Holdings can collapse
- No safety net
- Prestige exists, but only after total failure or voluntary reset

---

## 4. Target audience

### Primary
- Strategy game enthusiasts
- Business & finance-minded players
- Spreadsheet enjoyers
- Players who enjoy **thinking**, not clicking

### Secondary
- Entrepreneurs
- Economics students
- Hardcore simulation fans

### Explicitly NOT for
- Casual mobile gamers
- Players who want instant rewards
- Players who dislike complexity

---

## 5. Session design

SimulateBG is designed for **two session modes**, both valid:

### 5.1 Short session (5–10 minutes)
- Check KPIs
- Adjust prices / budgets
- Queue decisions
- Leave

### 5.2 Deep session (1–4 hours)
- Analyze multiple companies
- Reallocate capital
- Expand into new sectors
- Study trends & events
- Optimize long-term strategy

The game **never forces** long sessions, but **rewards depth**.

---

## 6. Core gameplay loop

```

Observe →
Decide →
Simulate →
Consequences →
Adapt

```

Detailed loop:

1. Observe world & company state
2. Make strategic decisions
3. Simulation engine runs weekly
4. Results are applied
5. Player adapts strategy

There is no “win screen”.  
Progress is measured in:
- Net worth
- Reputation
- Stability
- Longevity

---

## 7. Progression philosophy

### 7.1 Reputation
- Levels 1–999
- Slows exponentially
- Improves:
  - Financing conditions
  - Brand loyalty
  - Market tolerance

### 7.2 Skills
- Permanent modifiers
- Small but cumulative
- Unlock over time

### 7.3 Prestige
- Voluntary or forced reset
- Keeps meta bonuses
- Allows faster, smarter next run

Progression **never** replaces strategy.

---

## 8. Competition model

- Bots represent the majority of the market
- Other players exist but are **not required**
- No PvP combat
- Competition is:
  - Economic
  - Indirect
  - Systemic

You win by **outlasting**, not by attacking.

---

## 9. Monetization philosophy (future)

> *Design assumes ZERO monetization impact.*

If monetization exists:
- Cosmetic only
- No boosts
- No skips
- No economic advantages

The economy must remain **pure**.

---

## 10. Visual & UX philosophy

- Calm, Japandi-inspired
- Executive dashboard feel
- Minimal color
- No flashy animations
- Data clarity > spectacle

The UI should feel like:
> “A Bloomberg terminal for a simulated economy.”

---

## 11. Non-goals (important)

SimulateBG will **never** be:
- A clicker
- A gacha
- A city builder
- A story-driven RPG
- A fast-paced competitive game

Complexity is intentional.

---

## 12. Success definition

SimulateBG is successful if:
- Players discuss strategies
- Players fail and restart
- Players learn to read the economy
- Players feel responsible for outcomes

> *If a bankruptcy hurts emotionally, the design succeeded.*

---

## 13. Long-term vision

Future expansions may include:
- Multiple worlds
- Regional markets
- Trade between worlds
- Multiplayer funds
- Player-run conglomerates

But **only after** the core simulation is rock-solid.

---

## 14. Design mantra

> **“Clarity over comfort. Consequence over convenience.”**
